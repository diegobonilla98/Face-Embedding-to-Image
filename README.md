# Face-Embedding-to-Image
A network learns to reconstruct original face from the embeddings used in facial recognition softwares.

The model is in keras (sorry) and uses a Mapping Network and a GAN to generate the faces. Not the ideal model (should used StackGAN for example, but who's counting...) but the model clearly generates some human-kinda-look-alike images that resembles the not seen inputs.
